The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils. In the end some vanilla and camomile note. In the aftertaste, too. Though the hop, a bit too sweet.

              "4  According to the website, the style for the Caldera Cauldron changes every year. The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.   \n",

The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.</td>\n",

The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils. In the end some vanilla and camomile note. In the aftertaste, too. Though the hop, a bit too sweet.

              "4  According to the website, the style for the Caldera Cauldron changes every year. The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.   \n",

The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.</td>\n",

The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils. In the end some vanilla and camomile note. In the aftertaste, too. Though the hop, a bit too sweet. Honest.   \n",
              "4  According to the website, the style for the Caldera Cauldron changes every year. The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.   \n",

The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.</td>\n",

The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils. In the end some vanilla and camomile note. In the aftertaste, too. Though the hop, a bit too sweet.

              "4  According to the website, the style for the Caldera Cauldron changes every year. The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.   \n",

The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.</td>\n",

Appearance: pours amber colored with a tan head, good retention. Smell: Malty, just a hint of the sulphur like aroma that I associate with pilsners usually. Taste: Malty with a bit of an odd aftertaste, it is a bit like the cooked vegetable taste you sometimes find, but not nearly as unpleasant. Overall impression: Pretty drinkable, a bit different than some of the other amber type beers you see more of. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for it, though.  \n",

The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of camalized malt, toffee, with hints of herbal hops. The taste has the malty tones of the aroma with the addition of a firm bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and nicely low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that makes me wish there were more doppelsticke altbiers out there.  \n",

Rick blackish-brown brew, opaque, tan head, spotty lacing. Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again.  \n",

Served in 12 oz. snifter. Was extremely excited to see this on cask after hearing about how different it is than on tap. Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.  \n",
              "443652  A - Pours a medium brown color with a little clarity. The lighters hint of red shows in the light. Looks thick at first glance. Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.  \n",

This is bland. Sure it has a nice colour to it, dusty light amber. Nose is OK, typical of a wit. This is one of these unoffensive beers with no character or outstanding flavours. Bland, boring and absolutely unexceptional. I can taste the corriander and orange, along with just a slight touch of bannana if I really concentrate. Everything about this beer is just too mild. Not BAD, just too mild.  \n",

S: Classic wit aroma of corriander, orange rind & tropical fruit. T: Tropical fruit with some rind and a good spicing. Fairly malty & the American pale variety doesn't really work, leaving a bit of an American Wheat with spice feeling. M: Moderate body seems more malty than wheaty. D: Approachable, but not overly flavourful. I find it more like Keiths or Rickards than most craft.  \n",

Part of a Mix pack from Marketplace Wine and Spirits in Central Jersey. Pours vibrant yellow with one finger of foam that coats the glass. Aroma is mellow, with coriander being dominant on the nose. First sip is... ok. I detect a diacetyl buttery flavor, along with the coriander and vanilla notes. The malt and yeast take a back seat to the aforementioned flavors. Finishes kind of flat... could use a spicy yeast bite or more residual sweetness to round out the tastes. Mouthfeel is pretty thin. Nicely drinkable. Just lacks the complexity of flavors to elevate this into the level of truly good.  \n",

Let's investigate. ABV 6.5% with blurbs about their spices. Pours with a slightly hazy peach golden hue topped with an instantly deflated this fizzy beige cap. Nose is a big bold erratic mix of spices that mostly consist of coriander and nutmeg. Some flour pancake scents in there too. First swigs: Spice bomb! A tad honeyish. Lots of coriander and cinnamon. Dusty with a touch of wet leather. Finishes with a dry orange lolipop. Feel is shushy soft with a rolling medium to thick body. Coats the tongue. Last swigs: An ok overly spiced thick wit. Thickness pulls this one away from a trad wit. A little mixed up, but would really be interesting with a touch of chery.  \n",

Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again.</td>\n",

Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.</td>\n",

Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.</td>\n",

I detect a diacetyl buttery flavor, along with the coriander and vanilla notes. The malt and yeast take a back seat to the aforementioned flavors. Finishes kind of flat... could use a spicy yeast bite or more residual sweetness to round out the tastes. Mouthfeel is pretty thin. Nicely drinkable.

Some flour pancake scents in there too. First swigs: Spice bomb! A tad honeyish. Lots of coriander and cinnamon. Dusty with a touch of wet leather. Finishes with a dry orange lolipop. Feel is shushy soft with a rolling medium to thick body. Coats the tongue. Last swigs: An ok overly spiced thick wit. Thickness pulls this one away from a trad wit.

Appearance: pours amber colored with a tan head, good retention. Smell: Malty, just a hint of the sulphur like aroma that I associate with pilsners usually. Taste: Malty with a bit of an odd aftertaste, it is a bit like the cooked vegetable taste you sometimes find, but not nearly as unpleasant. Overall impression: Pretty drinkable, a bit different than some of the other amber type beers you see more of. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for it, though.  \n",

The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of camalized malt, toffee, with hints of herbal hops. The taste has the malty tones of the aroma with the addition of a firm bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and nicely low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that makes me wish there were more doppelsticke altbiers out there.  \n",

Rick blackish-brown brew, opaque, tan head, spotty lacing. Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again.  \n",

Served in 12 oz. snifter. Was extremely excited to see this on cask after hearing about how different it is than on tap. Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.  \n",
              "4       A - Pours a medium brown color with a little clarity. The lighters hint of red shows in the light. Looks thick at first glance. Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.  \n",

This is bland. Sure it has a nice colour to it, dusty light amber. Nose is OK, typical of a wit. This is one of these unoffensive beers with no character or outstanding flavours. Bland, boring and absolutely unexceptional. I can taste the corriander and orange, along with just a slight touch of bannana if I really concentrate. Everything about this beer is just too mild. Not BAD, just too mild.  \n",

S: Classic wit aroma of corriander, orange rind & tropical fruit. T: Tropical fruit with some rind and a good spicing. Fairly malty & the American pale variety doesn't really work, leaving a bit of an American Wheat with spice feeling. M: Moderate body seems more malty than wheaty. D: Approachable, but not overly flavourful. I find it more like Keiths or Rickards than most craft.  \n",
              "424058                                                                                          i just picked up a sixer of this at my local grocery store. never once seen or heard of it before. 12oz bottle out of the fridge poured into a imperial pint. \"brewed by the southern tier brewing company for ellicottville brewing company\" stated on the side of the bottle. pours out a golden color with just a slight haze. about a one finger of white head with average retention and minimal lace. very citrusy aroma. lemon zest and orange peel are the main players. bits of wheat and citrusy hops in the background. initial sip was \"wow, this is a hoppy wit\" and it is. again citrus rules here. lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit citrus hops, every kind of citrus. wheat and grainy pale malts struggle to balance the hops and some spice towards the finish. simple, but very nice tasting. light body, fizzy carbonation which compliments the beer nicely. hops are definatly felt on the palate, similar to that of pale ale. oh so drinkable, exspecialy cause its a favorite small local brewery. its light, hoppy, but still a wit, makes for many six packs this winter. reminds me just a bit of southern tier's hop sun. this is definately worth a try if its in your area.  \n",

Finishes kind of flat... could use a spicy yeast bite or more residual sweetness to round out the tastes. Mouthfeel is pretty thin. Nicely drinkable.

Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.</td>\n",

Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it.

Appearance: pours amber colored with a tan head, good retention. Smell: Malty, just a hint of the sulphur like aroma that I associate with pilsners usually. Taste: Malty with a bit of an odd aftertaste, it is a bit like the cooked vegetable taste you sometimes find, but not nearly as unpleasant. Overall impression: Pretty drinkable, a bit different than some of the other amber type beers you see more of. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for it, though.   \n",

The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of camalized malt, toffee, with hints of herbal hops. The taste has the malty tones of the aroma with the addition of a firm bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and nicely low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that makes me wish there were more doppelsticke altbiers out there.   \n",

Rick blackish-brown brew, opaque, tan head, spotty lacing. Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again.   \n",

Served in 12 oz. snifter. Was extremely excited to see this on cask after hearing about how different it is than on tap. Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.   \n",
              "443652  A - Pours a medium brown color with a little clarity. The lighters hint of red shows in the light. Looks thick at first glance. Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.   \n",

Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.</td>\n",

Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it.

Appearance: pours amber colored with a tan head, good retention. Smell: Malty, just a hint of the sulphur like aroma that I associate with pilsners usually. Taste: Malty with a bit of an odd aftertaste, it is a bit like the cooked vegetable taste you sometimes find, but not nearly as unpleasant. Overall impression: Pretty drinkable, a bit different than some of the other amber type beers you see more of. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for it, though.   \n",

The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of camalized malt, toffee, with hints of herbal hops. The taste has the malty tones of the aroma with the addition of a firm bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and nicely low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that makes me wish there were more doppelsticke altbiers out there.   \n",

Rick blackish-brown brew, opaque, tan head, spotty lacing. Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again.   \n",

Served in 12 oz. snifter. Was extremely excited to see this on cask after hearing about how different it is than on tap. Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.   \n",
              "443652  A - Pours a medium brown color with a little clarity. The lighters hint of red shows in the light. Looks thick at first glance. Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.   \n",

Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so.

Appearance: pours amber colored with a tan head, good retention. Smell: Malty, just a hint of the sulphur like aroma that I associate with pilsners usually. Taste: Malty with a bit of an odd aftertaste, it is a bit like the cooked vegetable taste you sometimes find, but not nearly as unpleasant. Overall impression: Pretty drinkable, a bit different than some of the other amber type beers you see more of. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for it, though.   \n",

The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of camalized malt, toffee, with hints of herbal hops. The taste has the malty tones of the aroma with the addition of a firm bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and nicely low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that makes me wish there were more doppelsticke altbiers out there.   \n",

Rick blackish-brown brew, opaque, tan head, spotty lacing. Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again.   \n",

Served in 12 oz. snifter. Was extremely excited to see this on cask after hearing about how different it is than on tap. Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.   \n",
              "443652  A - Pours a medium brown color with a little clarity. The lighters hint of red shows in the light. Looks thick at first glance. Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.   \n",

Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.</td>\n",

Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it.

Appearance: pours amber colored with a tan head, good retention. Smell: Malty, just a hint of the sulphur like aroma that I associate with pilsners usually. Taste: Malty with a bit of an odd aftertaste, it is a bit like the cooked vegetable taste you sometimes find, but not nearly as unpleasant. Overall impression: Pretty drinkable, a bit different than some of the other amber type beers you see more of. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for it, though.   \n",

The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of camalized malt, toffee, with hints of herbal hops. The taste has the malty tones of the aroma with the addition of a firm bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and nicely low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that makes me wish there were more doppelsticke altbiers out there.   \n",

Rick blackish-brown brew, opaque, tan head, spotty lacing. Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again.   \n",

Served in 12 oz. snifter. Was extremely excited to see this on cask after hearing about how different it is than on tap. Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.   \n",
              "443652  A - Pours a medium brown color with a little clarity. The lighters hint of red shows in the light. Looks thick at first glance. Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.   \n",

Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.</td>\n",

Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.</td>\n",

Appearance: pours amber colored with a tan head, good retention. Smell: Malty, just a hint of the sulphur like aroma that I associate with pilsners usually. Taste: Malty with a bit of an odd aftertaste, it is a bit like the cooked vegetable taste you sometimes find, but not nearly as unpleasant. Overall impression: Pretty drinkable, a bit different than some of the other amber type beers you see more of. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for it, though.   \n",

The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of camalized malt, toffee, with hints of herbal hops. The taste has the malty tones of the aroma with the addition of a firm bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and nicely low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that makes me wish there were more doppelsticke altbiers out there.   \n",

Rick blackish-brown brew, opaque, tan head, spotty lacing. Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again.   \n",

Served in 12 oz. snifter. Was extremely excited to see this on cask after hearing about how different it is than on tap. Deep brown in color and quite cloudy in appearance. Head settled somewhat quickly, but some did retain and the lacing was noticeable. The first thing you notice with this one is the malt. Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%. Doesn't work against the beer but it is definitely noticeable the whole time. Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer.   \n",
              "443652  A - Pours a medium brown color with a little clarity. The lighters hint of red shows in the light. Looks thick at first glance. Head is only able to get to half inch before settling to a thin cap. Retention and lacing both look good. S - Very malty. Seem to be getting several aromas from this beer. Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out.   \n",

Just smells like thick and tasty malt. Loads of caramel. Little bit of dark fruit in the back, but very hidden. Not surprisingly, the taste is very malty and excellent. Sweet, but not too much so. The dark fruit flavors are there, and a very nice balance to the big malt flavor. The alcohol is not hidden particularly well considering it is only around 8%.

Bread (toasty and crusty), burnt caramel, and raisin are all heated ever so slightly by the alcohol. Pretty impressive overall. T - Starts out with some toasted bread and some sugary caramel flavors. Alcohol is warm and works well with the malty goodness. Dark fruit is present but pretty mild. I'm getting raisin and maybe some plum as well. At this point the unexpected happens. Alcohol flavor goes crazy and is just a kick in the teeth toward the end. Just enough though. M - Medium bodied with a light carbonation level. Finish is mostly sweet with some alcohol that lingers. Very creamy. D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it.

Just a great, refined malt aroma. Perfect dark red color. Monstrous body, which seems to elevate all the juicy malt flavors. Doughy, pastry like malt flavors initially, which on the mid-palate transform into rich layers of vinous fruits, which hints of blueberries, plums, figs and cherries. On the finish, another complete transformation comes into play and toffee, caramel, vanilla and more vinous fruit flavors linger.

              "      <td>Very rich and vibrant aroma, which hints of brandy soaked malts and loads of fruits, cherries, grapes, along with wine, caramel anc chocolate. Just a great, refined malt aroma. Perfect dark red color. Monstrous body, which seems to elevate all the juicy malt flavors.

The first time I tried it there was a bad cork taste to it or something happened to the taste that it just wasn't right. I went back to the store and tried another bottle and this didn't the bad taste to it but it didn't live up to all the hype. It was a decent drinkable beer but nothing outstanding and not worth the $20 for a 750ml. It was probably one of the lightest Sam Adams beers that I've tried.   \n",
              "295444  A: Poured from a bottle to a flute glass. Had a golden yellow color and a slightly hazy consistency. There was a big, fizzy, fairly long-lasting head. Not much lacing. S: A sharp acidic smell, with traces of hops, malt and a vinous quality. T: This is a fairly acidic beer, and it threatens to dominate the flavor. There are also traces of citrus, hops, that vinous quality, and a maltiness in the finish. In some ways, the taste is just too unfocused. M: A well-carbonated beer with a surprisingly dry finish. Light-bodied. O: This is my first Biere de Champagne, so I don't really have a frame of reference. That being said, I found this beer to be very uneven in spots. I look forward to trying other examples of the style.   \n",

Pours a hazy orange/copper color with a medium off-white head. AROMA: Light sour cherry and malt. FLAVOR: Harsh bitterness reminding me of aspirin. There are some grapefruit and malt flavors. MOUTHFEEL: Medium body with dry chalky feel. DRINKABILITY: I pour this beer down the drain after a few sips. Not sure if I had a bad batch but the bitterness I got was horrible.

              "510568  It has long been my dream that one day, during my lifetime, aliens will land on the planet Earth, bringing to us great gifts of technology, culture and art. I continue to hope this will happen. And if it does, I also pray that whomever is the first to meet the aliens doesn't give them a bottle of Long Trail Blackbeary Wheat, or those fuckers will blow this goddam little dirtball up, and head on to greener pastures. Appearance: Pours BMC clear into my glass, a few lazy bubbles and a rather reluctant head. It froths up, but only for as long as it takes to convince you that it's serious, and then immediately runs off and takes a nap. Smell: If I may have an Oingo Boingo moment. When I was a lad, my mom used to take my sister and I to a restaurant at Northgate Mall on a semi-regular basis. With our meals (whether it was breakfast or lunch) we would always get a Slush Puppy. I don't know if you are familiar with a Slush Puppy, but it is essentially a cup filled with crushed ice then covered with a flavored syrup. The idea was that the syrup would melt this crushed ice and you'd have a nice, cold, fruity drink. However, if you were smart about it, you could drink the syrup quick as a mofo, and never have to deal with any of that goddam ice. These syrups came in all sorts of flavors like root beer, blueberry, watermelon, bubble gum, etc. Basically the same shit you get at the dentist when they are offering you flavors for your fluoride (peanut butter, man. You have GOT to go with the peanut butter.) Well, one of the flavors offered at the Slush Puppy Syrup Bar was blackberry. This beer smells just like that. Taste: I remember very clearly when Count Chocula, Franken Berry and Boo Berry cereals came out back in the 70s. As far as I was concerned, any cereal with monsters on it had to kick ass. And it did, when I was seven. This beer tastes like the milk you'd get if you let your Boo Berry sit long enough to extract some of that high fructose corn syrup goodness, except without the 'goodness' part. Gah! There it is again. Mouthfeel: I sure wish I had a Slush Puppy right about now... Drinkability: In the interest of maintaining intergalactic peace, I'm pouring this beer out.   \n",

Unfortunately and inexplicably it all goes down hill from there. The body is watery and the roasted lightly smoky flavor is the only evidence malt was used. No noticeable bitterness or spice is present. Very disappointing.   \n",

This one is a dead ringer for American Budweiser with a more noticeable spicy aroma. Bud is one of my least favorite beers and this one just did nothing for me.   \n",

I continue to hope this will happen. And if it does, I also pray that whomever is the first to meet the aliens doesn't give them a bottle of Long Trail Blackbeary Wheat, or those fuckers will blow this goddam little dirtball up, and head on to greener pastures. Appearance: Pours BMC clear into my glass, a few lazy bubbles and a rather reluctant head. It froths up, but only for as long as it takes to convince you that it's serious, and then immediately runs off and takes a nap. Smell: If I may have an Oingo Boingo moment. When I was a lad, my mom used to take my sister and I to a restaurant at Northgate Mall on a semi-regular basis. With our meals (whether it was breakfast or lunch) we would always get a Slush Puppy. I don't know if you are familiar with a Slush Puppy, but it is essentially a cup filled with crushed ice then covered with a flavored syrup. The idea was that the syrup would melt this crushed ice and you'd have a nice, cold, fruity drink. However, if you were smart about it, you could drink the syrup quick as a mofo, and never have to deal with any of that goddam ice. These syrups came in all sorts of flavors like root beer, blueberry, watermelon, bubble gum, etc. Basically the same shit you get at the dentist when they are offering you flavors for your fluoride (peanut butter, man. You have GOT to go with the peanut butter.) Well, one of the flavors offered at the Slush Puppy Syrup Bar was blackberry. This beer smells just like that. Taste: I remember very clearly when Count Chocula, Franken Berry and Boo Berry cereals came out back in the 70s. As far as I was concerned, any cereal with monsters on it had to kick ass. And it did, when I was seven. This beer tastes like the milk you'd get if you let your Boo Berry sit long enough to extract some of that high fructose corn syrup goodness, except without the 'goodness' part. Gah! There it is again. Mouthfeel: I sure wish I had a Slush Puppy right about now... Drinkability: In the interest of maintaining intergalactic peace, I'm pouring this beer out.</td>\n",

This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.  "

Somebody. Thanks! A - Opaque black with dark brown edges. Tight, half finger brown head has medium retention, leaving a thin collar. Not much in the way of lacing. S - The expected coffee rush hits first. Big, huge coffee aromas. Honestly smells more like coffee than beer. But in a good way. Some chocolatey and licorice aromas break it up. T - Equally coffee-soaked, with the same chocolate and licorice background. Some plummy fruit flavors in there too. M - On the softer side, but too prickly to be higher than a 4. D - Very high. One of the most drinkable coffee stouts I've had. Solid for sure, but lacking somewhat in depth. Perhaps if I had it a bit fresher, I'd get more complexity out of the coffee itself. But even without the depth I expected, it's still a fine beer.\\n30712                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             thanks to Tilley4 for the hookup. Pours a coppery-yellow with a two-finger head that slowly fades into a delicate haze of bubbles on the surface and a sticky ring of lacing where the head once was. Aroma is fairly mild, with a strong lemony citrus presence. Taste is similar, with the citrus balanced by a malt sweetness. Higher carbonation gives the impression of a lighter body and crisp finish. Very drinkable, more sessionable than other beers in its class. A solid American IPA.\\n33680                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Pours pitch black into a snifter. Thin, wispy tan head disappears faster than the stock market's value. Big coffee & bourbon on the nose. A quick swirl leaves a thin sheet on the sides of the glass, and allows notes of vanilla, chocolate, fig, and leather to appear. Coffee and bourbon dominate at cellar temp, but warming brings an incredible bouquet of flavors, with more chocolate, vanilla, and tobacco. Thick and full bodied, but not too syrupy or viscous. Silky smooth, this goes down incredibly easy, with only a light alcohol burn in the long finish. Absolutely incredible. Nectar of the gods. Beer like this makes me happy I'm alive.\\n57340                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       On tap at the Bruery 1st Anniversary party. Reviewed from notes. A - Pours a murky tequila sunrise. Red in the core & inner layers, gradually transitioning to a golden yellow. Strangest colored beer I've ever seen. No head whatsoever. S - Caramel, toffee & green apple first, followed by milder stone fruit aromas (peach, nectarine, etc.). Definite booze burn on the nose as well. T - Very fruity on the palate compared to the nose. Apples, overripe peaches, and plums are mixed in with the caramel and toffee flavors. A definite caramel apple vibe to it. On the hot side. The flavors all seem to be fighting for control of the palate, but not in a good way. A bit messy. M - Full body, with super light carbonation. A bit on the syrupy side. D - A born sipper. Best in small doses. I like that they had this on tap, to provide comparison with the blended and barrel-aged versions. Drinking the virgin version shows why the barrel aging was so essential in bringing this beer together.\\n57399                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               On tap at The Bruery's 1st Anniversary shindig. Reviewed from notes. A - Pours a murky cherrywood red with gold highlights. Two-finger tan head has medium staying power, leaving little lacing behind. S - Strawberry & cherry, with some vinegar & light funk. Very fruity. T - The palate is pretty much the same as the nose, with the red fruitiness predominating. A bit of funky earth and vinegar. Nice sour bite. M - Crisp & big-bubbled. Short, dry finish. D - Very high at the moment. Would make a nice session sour. The folks at the Bruery made sure to note that this is a young version of this beer, and it shows. This is a solid brew right now, but some time will help build up the complexity and put this over the top.\\n57926                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         A - Orange-gold color. Massive four finger off-white head; fat cap & collar with thick, chunky lacing. S - lemon, grass, & herbs. A bit floral. The basil makes its presence known. Interesting. Very aromatic. T - earthy yeast, citrus, grass, and herbs. A dash of noble hops. Tasty. M - Light bodied. Longer finish than expected. Spritzy carbonation. D - not a hint of ABV. Goes down very easily. The Bruery keeps impressing me. Kudos to Patrick for taking a common style and putting a unique twist on it.\\n59697                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         On tap at the Bruery's 1st Anniversary party. Reviewed from notes. A - Pours a super pale, super cloudy straw color. Big, fluffy head leaves some decent lacing. S - Bretty horse funk, toasted bread, lemon peel and herbs. Much more horse funk than the standard De Lente, as expected. T - Similar to the palate, with a bit more lemony citrus in addition to the breadyness and funk. M - Big-bubbled carbonation makes for a bright & spritzy mouthfeel. Very, very dry. D - Good, but would be better for funkheads. The funk is a bit too much for me as far as the style goes. A fun beer to try, but a bit too funky for me. With all of the amazing offerings coming from the Bruery, this is probably one I won't revisit.\\n59999                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A - pale straw color. Huge, pillowy four-finger head. Not a lot of lace. S - wildflowers, citrus, banana, and coriander. Very floral and spicy. T - Honey and citrus hit first. The floral character comes in later, with a bit of banana and tropical fruit flavors. A slight herbal hop presence. Quick, bright finish. Bone dry. M - Light bodied. Spritzy carbonation. D - Light and easy to drink, but the spices are too overwhelming to want more than a bottle. A very nice wit, but it's so heavily spiced it reduces drinkability quite a bit. Aside from that, it's very tasty, and worth a shot.\\n61358                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            One of the single-barrel versions that Patrick was popping on the hour at the Bruery's 1st Anniversary Party. Reviewed from notes. A - Pours cola brown with dark ruby highlights. No head whatsoever, but at 17% ABV, that kinda has to be expected. A quick swirl leaves wine-like legs streaming down the sides of my glass. S - Insanely aromatic. Bourbon, caramel, vanilla, and brown sugar abounds. Some dark fruityness from the original Papier comes through, with figgy, pruny notes. Some earthy leather in the back. The 17% makes its presence known with a whiskey-like sting in the nostrils. T - Even more barrel influenced, if that is even possible. Huge bourbon and vanilla flavors, with toffee, caramel, and toasted oak as well. The fruityness pokes through just slightly, along with the leathery earth. This beer is miles deep. You get a new set of flavors with each sip. M - Shockingly smooth. Thick and creamy. A bit on the syrupy side, with a tiny amount of heat, but nowhere near what one would expect at 17%. Mind-blowing. D - This beer defines the term \"sippin beer\". 4oz would be more than enough for me, but it would be enjoyed for a long, long time. This is the kind of beer that you drink slowly, with about five other beer geek buddies. The Bruery blew my mind over and over at this party, and this one was damn near best-of-show. Considering that Melange #3 won't be bottled (at least not any time soon), I think this is the beer that will move The Bruery fully into the upper echelon of Craft Brewers. Absolutely outstanding.\\n61881                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          On tap at the Bruery 1st Anniversary Extravaganza. A - Murky porter brown. Reminds me of other RIS-influenced blended beers. Highlights are lighter brown. Thin, wispy head fades fast, leaving little lacing behind. S - Holy barrel-aged wonder! Huge whiskey aromas combine with vanilla, cocoa, and coffee notes. Dark fruityness (fig & prune) mix with a leathery earth in the back of the nose. A bit woody. T - Vanilla, cocoa, and caramel flavors hit first, followed closely by the dark fruit and earth overtones. More of a sweet, toffee-like candy flavor in the middle. Oak and whiskey throughout. Amazing depth. M - Full bodied, but not insanely huge. Tight carbonation keeps it silky smooth. Incredibly long finish. D - One of the most drinkable ales of this ABV I've ever had. This stuff is truly dangerous. One of the, if not the, best beers i've ever had. On par with any of the greatest beers in the world. This is one to sell your soul for. i just may.

A - Pours a super cloudy dark brown. Red highlights pop out when put up to the light. Almost no head at all, and in turn, no lacing. S - Big Flemish Red fruitiness pops out first, with raspberry and vinegar aromas, and some earthy funk. The Imperial Stout plays a huge role, adding a darkness to the fruit (blackberry), and adding soft cocoa aromas. The RIS really adds a whole other layer of depth to this beer. Very nice. T - The Flemish Red and RIS flavors seem a bit more integrated on the palate, with the blackberry, raspberry, and cocoa flavors all hitting at once. Some earthy funk and spice play a part as well. The RIS did little to calm the sour zing, which provides a nice balance to the fruit flavors. M - Medium body. Big, champagney bubbles make for a lively mouthfeel, and keep it dry. Medium-short finish. D - I could take this stuff down all day, no problem. My 4oz sample disappeared long before i wanted it to. Another tasty surprise from Patrick & Co. One can only wish that the insane sours coming out of this place will be bottled someday. Highly recommended!\\n62330                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             On tap at The Bruery's 1st Anniversary party. Reviewed from notes. A - Light, hazy peach color. Like the color of fresh grapefruit juice. Tiny head leaves little lace behind. S - Lemons, sour grapes, horsey funk, and red wine. Reminds me qite a bit of St Lamvinus in the nose, with the interplay of sour citrus and wine. T - Lemon rind & tart grapefruit hit first, followed closely by dirty funk and red wine. Nicely balanced & complex. Not as much of the grape influence on the palate as the nose. Slightly oaky. M - Light, crisp and dry. The Zin grapes give a distinctly tannic pucker to the mouthfeel. Big, champagney carbonation. D - Very high, especially for sourheads. A very nice sour, unique for California. A treat for anyone wanting to expand their sour palate.\\n62617                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I popped the cap on this lovely 750ml bottle and was greeted by a huge flow of foam, losing a solid 8th of the bottle. The rest was poured into a Bruery tulip. Very deep brown, bordering on black, with a soda-popish 3 finger off-white head that quickly dissolves into nothing. No collar, no lace whatsoever. Nose is quite complex, with chocolate, tobacco, plum, black cherry, anise, coriander, and banana. The fruit and spice hit the palate first, with the chocolate and tobacco followng close behind. Mouthfeel is bright and crisp, but the high carbonation gives it a very club soda-like feel. The nice blend of flavors with the crispness of feel gives it a very high drinkability. Unique and tasty, one I would definitely revisit.\\n75260                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         pours a crystal clear copper with a one finger head that quickly dissipates, & spotty lacing. Aroma is pretty mild, with pine, citrus, & grass as the predominant scents. Piney, grassy hops hit the tongue harder than expected, considering the nose, with grapefruit & some caramel sweetness to back it up. Crisp & refreshing; a great summer IPA.\\n125970                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Recieved this in the TIF from Kempleton. Thanks! Pours a murky dark amber color, with a frothy two-finger head and not much lacing. Nose is dark fruit and vinegar, with that lactic sour sting. The sourness hits first, but then quickly fades, giving way to sugar. Like pure sugar. This is waaay too sweet for the flemish sour style. The sweetness & sugar overpower any hint that his might be a Flanders Red. Tastes to me like what Dogfish Head would do with this style. Medium mouthfeel, but the sweetness takes away that crisp, palate-cleansing refreshment I so look forward to with Flanders Reds. If you're new to the style, it might be an interesting drink. if you've had any other Flanders Reds, avoid it.\\n132037                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thick, pillowy two-finger head. The head lasts and lasts, but surprisingly leaves little in the way of lacing. Nose is fruity & spicy, with the palate being mostly the same. Bright & crisp, washes away clean. A mild but present hop bitterness. Very drinkable. A simple, easy drinking Saison.\\n132311                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Reccommended to me by some danish dudes claiming to be the top raters on RateBeer ;-) Have a great trip guys! A - Cat black with a two finger dark brown head. Exellent retention. Light, spotty lace. S - Dark chocolate abounds, with light roasty notes and dark fruit. Some coffee in the back. Mostly a dark cacao fest, but balanced by roast. T - more of a coffee/chocolate split on the palate, with both elements playing equal, complementing roles. Some booziness. Any fruit aromas are lost in the coffee/cocoa competition. Still, it's incredibly satisfying. Like a local Dark Lord. M - mostly soft, but slightly prickly. Big, full body. A bit slick. D - sipper. The 10 ounce pour is quite satisfying. Pizza Port again prove themselves as being the best damn brewpub in the land. It's beers like these that make me happy I live nearby.\\n132573                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Pours a perfect pitch black with a thick, foamy, latte brown head. Huge coffee nose, with earth and leather behind it. Flavor is huge roasty coffee goodness. A bit of dark fruit comes around with the earthy notes. Smooth as silk and creamy as hell. One is enough, but that one is spectacular. This stuff is on par with any imperial stout I've had. If it were bottled, it would be legendary.\\n132987                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2008: Pours a clear, deep amber, almost ruby. no head to speak of. nose is all resiny, piny hops, with a present malt sweetness squeezing its way through. Huge caramel flavor, with grapefruit, orange, and pine thrown in the mix, and a nice, long finish. Quite the bitter kick at the end, as well. Mouthfeel is full and long- lasting, but not syrupy. Overall, an excellent brew. Another winner from Port. 2009: Upon further review and a bit of plate refining, this one seems quite a bit less appealing. A - Pours a ruddy plum-brown color. Almost no head at all. S - Major caramel and pine. Like a hoppy American barleywine without the nuance. T - Hop pine is the first, and most overwhelming flavor. Some caramel sweetness sets in, but just barely enough to ward off the hops. Unnecessarily bitter. M - Full body, but the light carbonation gives it a syrupy feel on the tongue. D - I drank enough to review it. Upon revisiting, I'd say this is a pretty big miss for Port. Oh, well. I'll just have to drink more Hop 15.\\n134807    A - Older Viscosity pours an opaque, inky black. huge khaki head is nice and tight - the same consistency as well made latte foam. Retention is fair at first, with the majority of the head fading slowly, but surely. Once the main foam faded, though, a quarter-inch layer stuck around, almost perpetually. Quite a sight to behold, really. S - The aroma starts off with major barrel influence, consisting of strong bourbon and vanilla oak aromas. With a bit of concentration, all kinds of wonderful things start to pop out. What begins with a heavy chocolate influence, slowly transforms into dark, sweet aromas of figs and raisins. A mild tobacco note in there too, like a bourbon-dipped cigar. The roasty coffee notes that one usually expects from an Imperial Stout of this magnitude are a fairly minor presence in the overall profile. Different notes come about with each whiff, which is one sign of a really great beer to me. T - The palate, surprisingly, doesn't start with one dominant flavor characteristic, as is common with the style. The first sip brings the dark fruit flavors found in the nose, followed closely by vanilla and caramel notes, finishing with roasty bitterness and more fruit. The second sip has distinctly more cocoa influence, and more bourbon character on the front end. Toasted oak and tobacco come in and out. The depth and complexity are really quite stunning. M - While the body is on the thin side (at least by Imperial Stout standards - it's still a monstrous beer), the fine, tight carbonation keeps it smooth and silky on the tongue. Oak tannins give it a mild astringency that gets the salivary glands going. The finish is on the sweet side, and seems to last forever. D - For a stout of this magnitude, one glass is enough. But the one is thoroughly enjoyed. This is a magnificent beer. Its depth, complexity, and unique flavor and aroma profile showcase the master artistry of its creator. For any lover of Imperial Stouts, or any beer that is an experience on its own, this is a must try.\\n135067                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Pours a cloudy copper into a tulip. Minimal head dissolves quickly into a thin collar with light, spotty lacing. Huge hop nose, more on the earthy/piney side, but some fruityness shows through. Hops dominate the palate as well, pine and spice. Caramel sweetness is noted, but it seems to lean too far to the hop side. Medium bodied, and a shorter finish than expected, considering the strength. Much lighter and more crisp than a comparable DIPA, which ups the drinkability. A fine beer, and an interesting DIPA alternative. A must-try for any port lover or hophead, but I think it lacks a bit in balance.\\n157764                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     pours a pale orange with a thick two finger head. Nose is all hops, citrusy and floral. Pure hops on the palate, with little malt backbone to back it up. Major bitter bite at the end, with notable alchohol burn. Dry and astringent. This beer proves that a beer is not made by hops alone. Not one that I'll revisit.\\n165253                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            A - Crystal clear amber with a thin, but dense head (bar pour leaves little room for head...). Nice, sticky lacing. S - A hoppy sonofagun, as expected. Super piney & resiny, with some citrus, wildflowers, and caramel malt for good measure. T - More malty than anticipated, but hop-forward is still an understatement. Piney, resiny hops abound, with the citrus and caramel still playing a supporting role. A bit of biscuit in the back that I didn't notice in the nose. Solid bitterness, but not overpowering. M - Medium-full body. Nice, fine carbonation. Smooth & slick. D - Good balance keeps it high for a DIPA. I wish this stuff turned up more often. A very solid DIPA. Doesn't really stand out from the pack, but is in the upper echelon of the standards. Try it if you come across it.\\n180295                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         A - Pours moonless Alaska winter night black. 1.5 finger khaki head has medium retention, and leaves bits of spiderweb lacing behind. It's amazing how dense this head is. Like I could stick a fork in it and it would stand up. This is how an Imperial Stout should look. S - The expected coffee rush comes first, but then surprisingly, a strong dark fruitiness comes through, with raisin, plum, and blackberry aromas. After the fruit shock, more of the roasty, charred notes become present, with a leathery earth component too. Some booze. After it warms, the fruit becomes less dominant, balancing nicely with the coffee & roast. Some milk chocolaty notes as well. Very nice. T - Big chocolate and dark fruit flavors out the gate. Chocolate is on the sweet milk chocolate side, with raisin, prune, blackberry and dark, sweet cherry flavors. The coffee is almost an afterthought, but it's there, along with some smoky roastyness. Some herbal hop character can be found in the back if it's looked for hard enough. Finish is almost tangy in a way. Like after eating a chocolate covered orange. A dash of heat, but nowhere would you be lead to believe that this was 12%. M - Smooth and creamy. Silky. Goes down like water. Thick, creamy, chocolaty water. Can not get any better. D - So creamy and smooth, with no sign of 12% abv, this one gets a super high score. Too rich to be perfect, but very high nonetheless. This is an excellent Imperial Stout. Stouts being overly sweet are usually a turnoff for me (I'm looking at you, Darkness...), but this grew on me over my two glasses. The exceptional creaminess and complexity make this one a winner in my book.\\n181738                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A - Dark orange color. Thick, rocky, pillowy white head lasts and lasts. Sticky lacing everywhere. One of the prettiest heads I've ever seen. In fact, the haze is the only thng keeping this from being a perfect 5 looker. S - Incredible hop bouquet. Grapefruit, tangerine, pine, grass, mint, and everything else hop wonderful. Some caramel sweetness and toasted grain aromas are in there, but this is pure hop poetry. T - All flavors coalece much more effectively on the palate. Tropical fruit and caramel on the front end, with some biscuit and bread towards the middle. The citrus, pine and grass come on the back end, with a solid bitter bite. Finish is on the dry side. M - Medium body. Soft, medium carbonation. Nice and bright. D - This is a beer that never lasts long enough. I could drink it every day. In my opinion, this is the king of California single IPAs. I have yet to try the famous Masala Mama, but for right now, this one is unmatched.\\n182682                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Winter 2007 Pours a deep amber with a thick, frothy head that just won't quit. Nose is caramelly, malty sweet, with strong citrus and a touch of pine. Flavour starts with sweet malts, with hints of tangerine, orange & plum. Definite hoppy bitter kick, but not till the end, and a fairly short, sweet finish. medium to full bodied, but so drinkable it's dangerous. it should be noted that this review is a 3-month aged bottle, so much of the review is in comparison to a totally fresh bottle. If my memory serves me well, the hop kick has subsided a bit, making for a much more balanced brew. I'm new to the whole aging thing, so it might just be all in my head (it seems to me like 3 months isn't a very long time when it comes to aging), but this has gone from one very tasty brew to one of my all-time favorites. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've never met an AleSmith i didn't like!\\n183253                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     2007 Vintage, Bottle 300/447. Poured into a New Belgium snifter. Pours blacker than the soul of Dick Cheney, with a thin wisp of a head that disappears as fast as it arrives. Huge coffee & bourbon on the nose, followed by oak, vanilla, and dark fruits. Coffee is the overwhelming flavor on the palate, followed closely by bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, dark fruit, leather, and smoke. Full bodied for sure, but not as huge and viscous as other Imperial Stouts of this magnitude. Saying it's thin is a bit of a stretch, but it's not as coating as you'd expect. Definite alcohol bite combined with the thickness dampens drinkability. It took four people to polish the bottle off. A fantastic beer, no doubt. Whether it's worth the time & money to acquire, the jury's still out.\\n184177                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Pours a viscous black with a two-finger head that quickly fades away. A good solid swirl leaves a thick, oily sheet along the sides of the glass. Hugely complex nose with chocolate, smoke, vanilla, earth, pine, citrus, and licorice. More of the roasted malt characteristics on the palate, with the chocolate and roastyness dominating at first, then the pine/earth of the hops and dark fruit flavors come to light. Boozy as hell, the 10% is not hidden very well, and it seriously takes away from the smoothness of the mouthfeel & the drinkability (I'd really like to try it again when its had about 2 years on it). I poured a glass, took about 5 sips, thought \"wow, this is intense!\", and dumped the rest of the bottle. Definitely not for the lighthearted, this is a fantastic brew for about the first 8oz.

S - Dark fruits and sherry. Caramel, toffee, and raisins. Citric and piny hops. Excellent depth. T - Caramelly sweetness with a dark fruity undertone. Leathery earth paired with a soft nuttiness. Pine-heavy hops in the middle & back. Warm & spicy alcohol on the finish. M - Medium-full body. Light carbonation keeps it smooth. Not as big as I'd like. D - Alcohol heat keeps the score down a bit, but the bottle makes for a good sipper all night long. I'm usually not aa fan of American-style Barleywines. Too much hops, heat, & coarseness (I'm looking at you, Green Flash...). This one may change my mind. Hoppy without losing its Barleywine soul, and smooth and silky mouthfeel, this is at the top of the local Barleywines that I've had.

Piney hop bitterness to finish. M - medium body, medium carbonation. Long finish. D - very high. I'm currently on my third pint. Yet another Alesmith beer that I wish was bottled.

Thick, chunky head fades fast, but leaves a thick collar and sheets of lacing. A bit more clarity would have been a perfect 5. S - solid Cali hop profile, with huge citrus notes of grapefruit and lemon rind. Slight pine in there too. Some tropical fruit and breast aromas round things out, but the aroma is hops, hops, and more hops. T - the palate follows the nose very closely. The hops are the main, overwhelming presence. The pine comes out a bit more on the palate, along with the citrus. Also, as in the nose, the fruitiness and bread struggle to come through, providing little balance. M - Medium body. Medium-fine carbonation keeps it creamy. Long, dry finish. D - As a hophead, I could finish a sixer of these without hesitation. Non-hopheads may have some difficulty. More proof that some of the best IPAs in the world come from San Diego. If you're looking for balance, I'd look elsewhere, but if it's a phatty hop sandwich you're after, this is a damn fine choice.\\n197625                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ON tap at Bottleworks in Seattle. Apparently this is a custom blend of the 2nd, 3rd, and 13th foeder in the New Belgium brewery, custom blended by the Bottleworks guys and spiked with brett on bottling. Reviewed from notes. A - Rich copper orange. Thick, dense white head. Medium retention. Thick collar & spotty lacing. S - Vinegar & funk. Tangerine & lemon peel. Some subtle breadiness. Very citrusy. T - Big citrus flavors. Tangerine, orange, and lemon. Mild brett funk. Slightly sweet. More tangy than sour. M - Light and soft. Fluffy carbonation. Dry, quick finish. D - Very high. More drinkable than La Folie, even. It was a real surprise that they had this on tap, and I'm very glad I tried it. A fine wild ale for sure.\\n197644                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  On tap at Stone Sourfest, reviewed from notes. A - Medium hazy gold/orange. No head and no lace. S - Orange & tangerine. Light funk. Lightly woody. Very citric. T - Very similar to the nose. Big orange citrus. Light, quick tartness. M - Light body, quick finish. Small, soft carbonation. D - Medium high. A solid sour. Similar to the Bottleworks X, but not quite as complex.

Nose is cherries & sweet fruits, with a bit of caramel maltyness & some oakiness. The sour cherry punch hits the tongue first, with sweet fruit & oak backing it up. Dry & tart, the mouthfeel is very nice, especially as a palate-cleansing after dinner drink. Crisp & refreshing. A perfect brew for a warm summer evening. Definately gives the rodenbach grand cru a run for its money. A very tasty brew, to say the least!

Thin tan head barely reaches a finger before fading to nothing. S - Sour cherries and vinegar. Some earth and must. That's about it, really. T - Cherries, vinegar, and dirt. Tart, but not sour. No real oak to speak of. All of the major Lambic flavors, without the subtle complexities. Seems to have been bottled before it got a chance to get interesting. Not bland, just seriously lacking in depth. M - right for the style. Medium-light body and effervescent carbonation. D - Good, I suppose. Possibly the least complex sour I've ever had. It's not really even that sour (if at all). A letdown for sure.\\n224266                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Reviewed from notes. A - Transparent rusty red/brown. Thick, 3-finger mother-of-pearl head. Chunky lace all over. S - Caramel & hazelnut. Pine & grass from the hops. Vanilla & oak. T - Caramel, toffee, vanilla, pine, and grapefruit. Big oak & malt dominance, but with a strong bitter bite. Rides the line between a DIPA and a barleywine. M - Medium-full mouthfeel. Carbonation is fairly soft. A bit resiny. D - Medium. Doesn't coalesce quite as well as other oaked DIPAs, but it still manages to be quite tasty. Worth a try.\\n235538                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A - Pours cherry red with copper highlights. Four finger, rocky tan head lasts a good while. Lacing is spotty. Pretty! S - Pale fruits & carmelized sugars. Toffee and butterscotch. Some grassy noble hops. T - Candy sweetness first, followed by pear and apricot. Spice in the middle. Well put together. M - Medium-light body. Big, prickly carbonation. Quick, dry finish. D - One is good for me. But the one is tasty and easy. A very nice beer and one of the best I've had of the style. A great introduction to the Southampton line.\\n246504                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            330ml bottle into a Delirium tulip. Pours a dark, ruby-rimmed brown. Insane head lasts for almost the whole glass, but leaves surprisingly little lacing. Beautiful nose on this thing. Plum, raisin, anise, coriander, and a hint of booze. The dark fruits and spice form a perfect balance on the palate. Wonderful. Medium mouthfeel. Crisp carbonation, but not too bubbly to prevent the flavor from lingering. Very drinkable. there's a reason that Chimay is the first thing people think when they hear the word Trappist, and this is it. A must try for any beer lover.\\n254465                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Picked this up from a few folks in a few trades. Thanks to all! A - Pours opaque black. Huge 3-finger brown head has insane staying power. Thick, chunky lacing is left behind, with a fluffy cap and thick collar. Pretty! S - Nose starts with sweet, caramelly espresso. Toffee, chocolate, fig, and smoke come through as well. T - Huge espresso, followed by caramel, toffee, and smoke. Slightly sweet, but balanced by roasty bitterness. Light alcohol burn. M - Soft and creamy, medium full. D - The alcohol brings it down a notch, but I keep wanting to go back for more. Absolutely delicious and deserving of the accolades.\\n403396                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2007 release. Pours a murky copper, bordering on red. Thin wisp of a head disappears almost instantly, leaving no lace behind. Cherries, dark fruit, spice and honey on the nose. A bit of warming brings the honey characteristic to the front. Cherries & honey are the main flavors, along with plum, raisin, licorice, and belgian yeasty spice. Medium body, crisp carbonation and a bit of alcohol sting. Considering the abv, I expected more pungency in the flavor and aroma. But the lightness in the body and crispness, along with the fact that the abv barely shows itself in the flavor, gives it dangerous drinkability. Enjoyable, for sure.\\n409970                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Thanks to Tilley4 for the hookup. Pours a reddish copper with a one-finger head that dissipates quickly, moderate lacing. Nose is all citrusy hops, with a hint of caramel malt. Taste is similar, with a strong lemony presence, a bit of pine, and caramel. A bit of a bitter kick, but not super strong. Great balance, and very drinkable.\\n447750                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A - Pours a dark, murky plum color, with a two finger pink head. Retention is minimal, with light, spotty lacing. S - Pure, delicious raspberry on the nose. A bit of earthyness & grass, but anything besides the raspberry struggles to get through. I'm ok with that. T - Carbonated raspberry juice. And I mean that in the best possible way. Not too tart; the sweet & tart are very well balanced. A bit spicy as well. M - Medium light body & spritzy carbonation. Semi-dry finish. D - light body & sweet/tart balance along with the low ABV makes this insanely sessionable. Another unique & delicious fruit beer from New Glarus. More than worthy of the acclaim it gets.\\n451622                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Thanks to Ughsmash for this one! Pours a murky apple cider golden brown into a snifter. Short one finger head leaves spotty lacing. Smells of cherries. Shocking, I know. Bits of caramel and spice here and there, bit the cherries almost completely dominate the nose. The first few sips are like liquid cherry candy. After a bit of warming, the caramel and spice pull out for a better balance. I kinda wish I hadn't chilled it at all. Medium body & carbonation make for a smooth drink. Too sweet to want more than one bottle, but the one is damn tasty. A very unique brew, perfect for a summer evening.\\n462881                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            pours a crystal clear light amber-orange. Nose is citrus with a mild malty sweetness. Smell is about the same, with more emphasis on the hop side. The abv barely shows, with only a mild alchohol warmth in the finish. Dangerously drinkable. Not as impressive as other beers of the style, but drinkable enough that i think I'll have another.\\n473489                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       recieved as an extra from greger. Pours a murky brown with a hint of orange, no head to speak of. Nose is citrus and caramel, with a huge alchohol scent. The booze is so strong it almost burns the sinuses. Cloyingly sweet, with some grapefruit & hop bitterness, and a serious alchohol burn. Thick & syrupy. Difficult to even sip. A messy attempt at a big beer.\\n482191                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Younger35 is the shiznizzle. Pours a cloudy garnet with a thin, wispy head that disappears in seconds. Cherries, grapes, oak, red wine, and vinegar on the nose. Sour grapes & cherries hit first, with oakiness and sweet fruit flavors following. Very rich & complex. Tart for sure, but not overpowering, with the sweeter side providing a nice balance. Finishes crisp & dry. This is the kind of sour that American brewers are trying to emulate. Easily up there with the best.\\nName: 0110x011, dtype: object\n",
